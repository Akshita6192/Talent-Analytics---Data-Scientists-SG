This year Bank of America has committed to double BAC Apple Pay adoption from approx. 800,000to 1.6 million users. Because it is such a anew technology there is no literature or experience on how to drive usage increase. The Model development team’s conjecture is that the fastest path to increase usage is to target customer that are similar to the ones currently using Apple Phones.  Model Development Purpose and Intended Use:  This model has been developed to support marketing to increase Apple pay adoption and usage. This Model will guide who is targeted in adoption marketing campaigns for Apple Pay.  This Model is based upon classification and regression tree(CART) model that identifies customers that have a high propensity to use Apple Pay. The population being studies consist of those customers hwo has phone capability to use Apple Pay application. The depended variable is an indicator that the customer has actually used Apple Pay or not. The model identifies the customer that look likes those who are currently using Apple Pay. Customers so identifies will be priories for initial market campaign.

In such scenario, the robots can use global map, constructed once using SLAM, for navigation. However, there might be changes in the environment around the robot while it is operating. These changes might be due to people moving or objects such as furniture that is displaced. In these situation, it is crucial to update the map used by robot for navigation. The changes due to furniture items are termed as low-dynamic as they can be observed only in between multiple traversals. In this work, a novel inference method to detect positions of objects such as furniture etc. is proposed. The proposed method is tested on standard datasets(consists of weeks of observations) and as well as on simulation testbed.The results show robust detection of low-dynamic objects even in the presence of occlusion.

Traditional localization and mapping techniques assumes static(non-changing) environment, but in real world operation the environment around robot is rarely static. Therefore, a robust mechanism to update the map, generated by robot, is required. In previous studies, occupancy grids are used to model these changes and maintain an updated map. In this study, a novel inference approach on occupancy grids is proposed to model different dynamic changes in map. The main aim of this study is to maintain updated map for robots working for long periods such as weeks. Implemented inference model for occupancy grids using Explicit-state Duration HMM and tested it on Long term dataset. We are able to track the areas effected by dynamic objects on a month long operation of robot.

After a workflow is executed, an email is sent to the user which contains any output or errors encountered during the execution of workflows. Further, if any output files are generated along with the execution of the workflows, those too are sent in as attachments along with the email. • The web-application was developed using Django 2.0.6 with PostgreSQL as Database back-end. • Celery, a Python based scheduling library was used for task automation in real-time. • Redis was used for managing real-time job queues.  • Project II: Predicting Equipment Failures for Minimising Faulty Hard Drives • Background: Hard Disks are filled with Helium gas which is difficult to seal and contain. A Hard Disk is sealed with the help of screws which are inserted with the help of a ""screw bit"". Hundreds of thousands of screws are put in place every day and the screw bit eventually wears out with use. A worn-out screw bit improperly puts in the screws, thus improperly sealing the Hard Disks. An improperly sealed Hard Disk would fail the ""Helium-Leak"" Test. Thus, it is pertinent to predict the right time to replace the screw bit to prevent faulty Hard Disks as well to minimize the wastage of screw bits. • Analyzed the error logs from the manufacturing machine and found a relevant trend in the occurrence of a certain error code which strongly correlated with ""bit wear"". • Developed a trigger mechanism which analyses the occurrence of errors in real-time and raises an alarm when the bit wear occurs. Implemented Multi-Objective Optimization to balance between maximizing the detection of bit wear and minimizing false alarms. see less",Central Singapore,https://www.linkedin.com/company/seagate-technology,seagate-technology,,,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Technology Analyst Intern,Aug-17,Dec-17,"• Worked as the sole developer with the Client Onboarding Team in the Equities Technology Division. • Maintained and extended an internal web dashboard used to onboard & service clients on the bank’s electronic trading platform, using ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript & HTML/CSS. • Refactored a large chunk of the codebase and migrated it to a clear-cut MVC Design Pattern. • Migrated the API Client from SOAP to REST for the entire application and set up robust data pipelines to consume JSON and instantiate appropriate Object Models. • Simultaneously undertook a database migration from Sybase to SQLite while also optimising large & complex SQL queries. • Developed Python scripts for the US, EMEA and APAC teams to automate crucial tasks in the operations pipeline.

Then, he normalizes the data using min-max normalization, which transforms the data into a common range, thus removing the scaling effect from all the variables and retains the original distribution of the variables. The scaled data is used to fit the neural network, which will predict the ratings. Dominic then validates the model by comparing the predicted ratings to actual ratings using root mean squared error (sum of differences between observations of both ratings). K-fold cross validation was also used to validate the model, so that every data point gets a chance to be in test set and training set.  • Dominic was able to conduct a statistical analysis to find out the trend for future revenue for a client in the transportation industry. At first Dominic uses ACF/PACF plots to determine that the data was non-stationary (mean and variance is dependent on time as plots did not show a quick drop-off in correlation after a small amount of lag between points.), so Dominic stationarize the time series through differencing by 1 degree. Given that the ACF shows no pattern of a smooth decay and decays to insignificance after lag 1, an MA(1) model was built to fit the data.

The objective of the project is to develop state-of-the-art tools for assessing the damages in buildings after a disaster event such as earthquake using various technologies such as wireless sensor network and remote sensing. As part of my PhD research, remote sensing based building damage assessment subsystem has been developed using 3D point clouds and very high resolution oblique images from manned aircraft and UAV platforms. This includes design and development of several methods for accomplishing the following major tasks: 1) Automatic delineation of individual buildings 2) 3D modelling of buildings using 3D point cloud 3) Image and 3D point cloud segmentation & classification 4) Automatic identification of various kinds of damage evidences required for damage assessment such as spalling, inclined elements, openings in building due to damage. . 5) Debris/rubble piles mapping and quantification in m3. 6) Synergistic use of remote sensing-based assessments with wireless senor-based assessments from other partners in RECONASS for improved assessment.  The methods developed through this research were integrated to build an automated damage assessment system which was thoroughly demonstrated using the data obtained through EU-FP7 project RECONASS (www.reconass.eu, a pilot project in the field of near real-time damage assessment).

Systems of macroscopic particles interacting via purely repulsive potentials undergo a jamming transition as their density increases, giving rise to mechanical rigidity to the system. The mechanical and transport properties of jammed materials originate from an underlying percolating network of contact forces between the particles. Our research concerns about the spatial correlation of the force network, the range of the correlations between the inter-particle forces.  Another strand of my research is focused on developing a new theoretical and computational framework to characterize the statistical features of suspensions of soft colloidal particles. These systems widely occur in biological and natural systems, and their understanding is important in technological applications such as cosmetics, three dimensional printing, drug delivery etc. The frameworks developed so far takes into account only effective two-body interactions, neglecting many-body interactions as they are too difficult to deal, both theoretically and numerically. Our research is to develop an original and flexible approach to describe the highly dense suspensions. Our formalism is a voronoi based, and it naturally takes many-body interactions into account.  • Optimization Techniques • Machine Learning : Regression Methods, Principal Component Analysis, Clustering • C/C++ and MPI based code development : Molecular Dynamics • Python for data analysis : cluster size and density distribution, correlation dynamics • Python, Gnuplot and Ovito for visualization • Voro++ (A C++ based library) for voronoi tesselation • Percolation Theory • Mentoring two undergraduate students on machine-learning based projects • Best presentation award in an International conference see less",Singapore,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ntusg,ntusg,,,Pivigo,Data Science Fellow (S2DS),Oct-19,Nov-19,"Delivered a data science project with Electrical Power Research Institute (USA), a nonprofit organization conducting public interest energy and environmental research.

Hospital departments typically operate as individual units, therefore integration of improvement efforts are usually isolated and limited to optimization strategies for a single process step such as one clinic session, or one operating block, or one episode of a patient’s care path. In my thesis, I aim to overcome isolated improvement and optimization approaches, and to allow a scope wide enough to include complexity due to interaction of different patient groups’ care paths and different key hospital resources. By including a high degree of real-life complexities in our models, one is able to investigate interactions with higher accuracy, and detect different kinds of contingencies. The downside of complex models and solutions tend to be rather specific. However, generalizability is highly important throughout the research projects, and for all developed approaches and models.

Ongoing projects: --Marketing analytics and product portfolio optimization with auxiliary data : Developing the engine for sales prediction with data on previous sales of different products, macro economy data and other data on related factors computed through cointegration techniques leveraging machine learning tools including ensemble learning, multilayer perceptron, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). --Anomaly detection for predictive maintenance in large scale production: Developing a platform for anomaly detection to facilitate predictive maintenance leveraging Bayesian statistical methods, deep learning, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. see less",Singapore,https://www.linkedin.com/company/panasonic,panasonic,,,Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology,Data Scientist,Mar-16,May-19,"Projects handled: -->Robust prescriptive analytics: Instead of just prediction the framework developed through this project goes one step ahead and makes prescription on what is to be done to minimize or maximize some objective function. By and large in real world problems the auxiliary variables (such as # of google searches, user review etc) that affect the final quantity of interest is ignored resulting in under-utilization of data. In this project the conditional probability distribution of the objective function is modeled as a function of decision variable and quantity of interest (say sales or revenue), conditioned on the auxiliary variable. Use cases: Applied different ML techniques such as local regression, random forest, correlation and regression trees and kNN under this framework. -->Data driven pricing with messy datasets: Developed an optimization engine for dynamic pricing which considers market competition by leveraging statistical machine learning and optimization, with unknown demand. Implemented a method for estimating the demand-price sensitivity form largely incomplete datasets (with ~70% missing/corrupted entries) to maximize the revenue. -->Real time predictive analytics for large sensor networks (IoT applications): Developed a method to select hundreds of sensors (out of thousands), for real time monitoring, maximizing the information content. Implemented algorithms for anomaly detection based on deep learning methods such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM). -->Risk modeling and management: Developed a model to quantify the catastrophic risk by using stochastic processes and designed appropriate business interruption insurance for supply chain disruption. -->Logistics (Deep learning for big data applications): Implemented a module based on deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and RNN using TensorFlow and Keras, to predict the service time of a delivery assignment. see less",Singapore,https://www.linkedin.com/company/singapore-institute-of-manufacturing-technology,singapore-institute-of-manufacturing-technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nanyang Technological University,Doctor of Philosophy - PhD,"Mathematical optimization, data science",,2012,2016,"Research focus: Machine learning, data analytics and optimization for cloud services.Project description:Developed optimization based models for revenue maximization and operational cost reduction for cloud service providers to increase the profitability.

Since these tests will not always have perfect detection, we also construct a bootstrap confidence interval for the true time of change. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the power of the tests, accuracy of the estimators and the performance of the bootstrap confidence intervals are studied.

I work very closely with the Management and scientists in DSI to help them identify technological developments that impact the strategic planning and project management.  I also formulate strategic reports and white papers for the Management and scientists. This dynamic nature of technology evolution facilitated my fact finding, writing and analytical skills. As the strategic reports have significant impact on DSI’s planning and roadmapping, I often have the opportunities to present these findings to the Management and scientists in DSI.  Integrating technological developments with statistical models and its visual representations has made me a flexible thinker who is able to adapt and pick up new knowledge. I am consistently seeking new and creative ways to improve my forecasting skills through the use of statistics and keeping myself abreast with the latest industry and academic developments.

The products I studied ranges from mobile devices to healthcare produces. My exposure to the wide spectrum of Panasonic products helped develop my strong analytical skills and the flexibility to absorb and understand different technologies. The process of studying the intricate details of products and their differentiating features developed my ability to look at the fine details in problems.  Being in a consumer electronics multinational company, I was expected to work under very tight deadlines. A considerable amount of my work involves providing supporting documentation to litigation processes. Legal battles usually occur at a very fast pace, Panasonic attorneys frequently requested ad hoc technical supporting documents for their lawsuits. These experiences help built my capabilities to do my best work under the stress of tight deadlines.  The Intellectual Property Rights Team was a twelve member team. The projects we handled were usually very demanding in both quantity and technological depth. This is where working well in a team is very important. I was privileged to be able to work with different people under different project leaders.
